# Evaluation Scripts

This directory contains four scripts (each for one benchmark task) for evaluating the models.
These scripts take a prediction file and calculate different task-related metrics.
Additionally, the scripts use bootstrapping to estimate the standard deviations of the scores and to find an 95% confidence interval estimate.
The calculated statistics are stored in a `json` file similar to the following.
```json
{
  "n_iters": 10000,
  "AUC of PRC": {
    "std": 0.02659696284278772,
    "median": 0.5334109872918915,

    "mean": 0.532867859291327
  },

    "value": 0.8701699757471121,

    "2.5% percentile": 0.8523142405908618,
    "mean": 0.87016429799627
  }
}
```

## Usage

The usage of the scrips is the following:
```
python -m mimic3benchmark.evaluation.evaluate_{task} [-h] [--test_listfile TEST_LISTFILE] [--n_iters N_ITERS]\
                                                     [--save_file SAVE_FILE] prediction
```

* `test_listile` should be a `csv` file similar to `data/{task}/train/listfile.csv` files.
This file should contain all the samples for which the models is predicting.
The default value of this parameter is the `data/{task}/test/listfile.csv`.
* `save_file` is the name of `json` file that should be produced.
* `n_iters` specifies the number of bootstrap iterations.
* `prediction` is a `csv` file similar to `test_listfile` with one addition that it also contains column(s) related to predictions.

The reason we have two similar files (`test_litfile` and `prediction`) is to have a way to ensure that there is a prediction for all samples of `test_listfile` and that `prediction` doesn't contain any wrong information about the targets.  
The format of `prediction` is task-specific and is described below.

### In-hospital morality
The prediction file should have 3 columns: `stay`, `prediction`, `y_true`.
Similar to task listfiles (`data/in-hospital-mortality/{set}/listfile.csv`), each `stay` defines an sample with `y_true` label.
Here is a part of a valid prediction file.
```angular2html
stay,prediction,y_true
28401_episode1_timeseries.csv,0.198586,0
52467_episode2_timeseries.csv,0.469585,1
8380_episode1_timeseries.csv,0.236593,1
30633_episode1_timeseries.csv,0.026102,0
```

### Decompensation and length of stay
The prediction file should have 4 columns: `stay`, `period_length`, `prediction` and `y_true`.
Similar to task listfiles (`data/{task}/{set}/listfile.csv`), each (`stay`, `period_length`) pair defines an sample with `y_true` label.
Here is a part of a valid prediction file for decompensation prediction task.
```angular2html
stay,period_length,prediction,y_true
12573_episode1_timeseries.csv,394.000000,0.000571,0
5598_episode4_timeseries.csv,394.000000,0.001081,0
94_episode2_timeseries.csv,394.000000,0.077848,0
93381_episode1_timeseries.csv,394.000000,0.002446,0
```
Here is a part of a valid prediction file for LOS prediction task.
```angular2html
stay,period_length,prediction,y_true
25256_episode5_timeseries.csv,5.000000,63.554131,480.366400
25256_episode5_timeseries.csv,6.000000,51.653477,479.366400

6468_episode1_timeseries.csv,84.000000,20.712656,5.788800
```

### Phenotyping
The prediction list-file should have 52 columns: `stay`, `period_length`, `pred_{i}` and `label_{i}`, where `i` ranges from 1 to 25 (the number of phenotypes).
Similar to task list-files (`data/phenotyping/{set}/listfile.csv`), each (`stay`, `period_length`) pair defines an sample with `label_{i}` labels.
Here is a part of a valid prediction file.
```angular2html
stay,period_length,pred_1,pred_2,pred_3,pred_4,pred_5,pred_6,pred_7,pred_8,pred_9,pred_10,pred_11,pred_12,pred_13,pred_14,pred_15,pred_16,pred_17,pred_18,pred_19,pred_20,pred_21,pred_22,pred_23,pred_24,pred_25,label_1,label_2,label_3,label_4,label_5,label_6,label_7,label_8,label_9,label_10,label_11,label_12,label_13,label_14,label_15,label_16,label_17,label_18,label_19,label_20,label_21,label_22,label_23,label_24,label_25
